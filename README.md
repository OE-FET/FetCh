Measurement suite for common FET and other electrical measurements, based on the [JISA](https://github.com/OE-FET/JISA) library.

## *Fetching* and Running FetCh

1. Make sure you have Java 11 or newer ([download](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=11))
2. Download the executable jar file: [FetCh.jar](https://github.com/OE-FET/FETTER/raw/master/FetCh.jar)
3. Run the jar file (you should just need to double-click it)

## Features

### Action Queue

Queue up measurements and actions to automatically run one after the other, allowing you to fully customise your measurement routine
